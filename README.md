# Libft
Project to recode the lib.c made at 42 school. Check my test code here: https://github.com/Kant1-0/libft-test if you wanna debug your own libft functions.

## Bonus
The libft also includes these other following projects:

* Get-next-line: read a given fd up to the next '\n' then send the new line.
* Ft-printf && Ft-dprintf: as fast as the printf function (using bitmap and static buffer to avoid repetitiv mallocs)
* some maths functions and other compare ones...
